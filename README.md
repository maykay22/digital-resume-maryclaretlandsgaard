My name is Mary Claret Landsgaard. I am studying Electrical Engineering at Mississippi State University. I am from Olive Branch, Mississippi and I have seven siblings. I did a co-op at International Paper in Columbus, Mississippi for a year and I learned a lot about power generation, transmission, and distribution in the setting of a paper mill.
